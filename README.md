<b>Depression</b> is a common illness worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people suffer from it. Depression may become a serious health condition. It can cause the affected person to suffer greatly and function poorly at work, at school and in the family.

At its worst, depression can lead to suicide. Close to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year.

Emerging research finds that many teens and young adults use social networking sites and mobile technology to express suicidal thoughts and intentions — often as a way to reach out for help.

In this research , we propose using machine learning algorithms for discovering whether or not the user of social media is experiencing depression or has any suicidal thoughts, by analyzing their social media behavior—Facebook comments, posts, tweets, etc.
